#Roles

These roles are all set to the guild's highest role when Titan is first invited.

##Admin Role

The Admin Role has access to **all** commands (apart from the /settings guild adminrole command, which is limited to the server owner)

They have access to all the permissions of the lower roles, and can control the guild's settings.

They can:

* Change the guild's moderator / tag management role
* Change the guild's welcome / leave settings
* Change the guild's ping protection settings

This goes without saying, but only give this role to someone you trust!
