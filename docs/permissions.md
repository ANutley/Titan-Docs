#Permissions

To function correctly Titan needs the following permissions:

* `Manage Nicknames` - For the changing the nicknames of users
* `Kick Members` - For kicking users
* `Ban Members` - For banning users
* `Manage Channels` - For changing the slowmode of channels
* `Manage Roles` - For assigning a role to users when they join

Titan will function without these permissions, it will just not be able to carry out the actions it does not have permission for.
